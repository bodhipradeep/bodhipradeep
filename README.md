- What it does: Recommends movies based on a selected movie’s metadata using TF-IDF vectorization and KNN with cosine similarity to find similar titles.
- Deployment: Hosted on AWS EC2   
🔗 [Repository](https://github.com/bodhipradeep/Movie_Rec_Content_base)

### 🧠 Agentic RAG System
- Approach: Combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with autonomous agent flow.
- Tech: llamaindex, Ollama, Groq, FAISS, OpenAI functions
- What it does: Enables documents (PDF and Excel) or web data to be turned into data visualization and conversational agents with memory and task execution.
- Deployment: GCP using Docker   
🔗 [Repository](https://github.com/bodhipradeep/Agentic-RAG-LlamaIndex)

### 🤖 Multi-Agent AI Chatbot
- Approach: Multi-agent LangGraph architecture for task delegation
- Tech: LangGraph, Groq, LangChain, Streamlit
- What it does: AI agents communicate to solve tasks—one agent fetches data, another verifies, and another generates output.
- Deployment: AWS EC2 instance
